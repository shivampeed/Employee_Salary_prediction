## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Streamlit**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Joblib** for model saving/loading

## 💡 How It Works

1. User inputs:
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Education Level
   - Job Title
   - Years of Experience

2. The input is passed to a **trained ML pipeline** (`salary_prediction_pipeline.pkl`).

3. The model outputs an estimated **salary (in INR ₹)** based on historical trends.
